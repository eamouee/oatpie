## A more efficient keyboard layout for English

Considerrig about 50,000 types within nearley 1,300,000 tokens (10 English novels) and doing a typing benchmark simulation process, it has achieved a new English keyboard layout which is up to 40% more efficient than US:QWERTY and up to 10% more than Dvorak, Colemak or Workman (these three are almost in a same level of efficiency).

In GNU Linux machines after cloning the ripo, run the codes below in a terminal:

``cd <your-path>/oatpie/``

``sudo bash ./linux/oatpie.sh``

Now restart the machine ond utilize presented English (Oatpie) keyboard layout.
